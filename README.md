This mini-project consists of three functionalities:
  1. Matrix Operations
        CreateMatrix, of some size
        ReadMatrix, either manually, or random elements are set
        ShowMatrix, in either Row Major or Column Major Order
        FreeMatrix, to delete the created matrix

  2. Number Representation Operations
        Bin2Int, to convert some 2's complement binary number to an integer
        Int2Bin, to convert an integer to its two's complement notation

  3. Floating Point Operations
        IeeeToFrac, to convert a bit sequence which is in IEEE 754 format (single or double precision), to a decimal fraction
        FracToIeee, to convert a decimal fraction number to its single / double precision IEEE 754 representation
